### [PyPy.js: What? How? Why?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiBfOFqDIAI)
- Demo: start at https://youtu.be/PiBfOFqDIAI?t=6m22s
- 3 goals:
    - Compatibility: handle numbers, etc. like Python, not JS
    - Performance: faster than system [C]Python! (PyPy++)
    - Web-ish-ness: evaluate JS, manipulate DOM, use JQuery
- PyPy + Emscripten -- LLVM-to-JS compiler (asm.js)
- Explanation: start at https://youtu.be/PiBfOFqDIAI?t=14m1s
- "It's awful all the way down"
- arewepythonyet.com
- faster than CPython on !Chrome
- > 20 MB JS downloads o_O
- py2exe? how about py2web + webapp manifest + apk factor!
- free stuff: Prolog!

### [Porting Python to run without an OS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYQ_lq5dcvM)

- Bonus round: https://youtu.be/bYQ_lq5dcvM?t=26m20s

### [Advanced Git](http://pyvideo.org/video/3392/advanced-git)
- Good, dense walkthrough; Jonathan and I both got a few good tips out of it.

### Have only watched parts of these, but heard really positive reviews:
- Raymond Hettinger: [Beyond PEP 8 -- Best practices for beautiful intelligible code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf-BqAjZb8M) (Hint: it's mostly not about PEP8!)
- Raymond Hettinger: [Super Considered Super](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiOglTERPEo)
- Ned Batchelder: [Facts and Myths about Python names and values](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AEJHKGk9ns)

## Type hints (PEP 484)
https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/
- Video's nothing special; exciting proposal, though

## Meeting my heroes / finding out they're real people
- Guido: "Fanboys, eh?"
- David Beazley: OMG WTF ASYNCIO
- Alex Gaynor (PSF director): talked real talk about Twitter/snarkiness
- Raymond Hettinger: just showed up in line for lunch!
- People who just sat down with me for lunch:
    - Gary Bernhardt (destroyallsoftware / "wat", closing keynote)
    - Nate Aune (Jazkarta / Appsembler), Anna Callahan (ZoomTilt), and baby!
- Asheesh Laroia: "THAT Sandstorm.io??"
- Harry Percival: begrudging selfie -> bottle of vodka for the table
- James Tauber (Eldarion, Gondor, Pinax, Thoughtstreams.io)
    - Just helping Anna get started with Pinax, nbd
    - 1:1 3-hour dinner?!?
- Ned (coverage.py): how exactly are we bros, again?

## Community
- Huge advantage of Python over other tech communities
- Multiple talk tracks on how to make tech culture suck less
- Jacob Kaplan-Moss: ["I am a Mediocre Programmer"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIJdFxYlEKE)
- Not from PyCon, but related: [Julie Pagano: "Battling the Invisible Monsters in Tech"](http://juliepagano.com/blog/2013/11/02/it-s-dangerous-to-go-alone-battling-the-invisible-monsters-in-tech/)
- Mealtimes and "hallway track" proved to be more valuable than many of the talks

## Business Value: Getting Our Name Out!
- I am almost out of business cards
- I---a lowly, self-funded Python Wrangler---dined, drank, and coded with multiple CEOs, CTOs, Python core devs, and big-name community members
- HUGE number of SMBs represented, all trying to sell us their stuff! (They could probably use some help...)
- Free career fair---you don't have to have a booth!
- Open source ==> street cred

## Boston Python!
